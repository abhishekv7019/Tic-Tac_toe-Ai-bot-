
The given code implements a Tic Tac Toe game using Pygame. The game allows a player to play against an AI which uses the minimax algorithm to make decisions. Here's a brief explanation:

1. Imports and Initialization:
   - Pygame is initialized.
   - Colors and display settings are defined.

2. Global Variables:
   - Game parameters such as screen dimensions, board size, and drawing settings are defined.
   - The game screen is set up, and the board is initialized as a 3x3 numpy array filled with zeros.

3. Helper Functions:
   - draw_lines(): Draws the Tic Tac Toe grid lines on the screen.
   - draw_figure(): Draws the X or O based on the board state.
   - mark_player(row, col, player): Marks a move on the board for a player.
   - available_square(row, col): Checks if a square is available.
   - is_board_full(check_board): Checks if the board is full.
   - check_win(player, check_board): Checks if a player has won.
   - minimax(minimax_board, depth, is_maximizing): The minimax function for decision making by the AI.
   - best_move(): Determines the best move for the AI using the minimax function.
   - restart_game(): Resets the game to its initial state.
   - display_message(message, color): Displays a message on the screen.

4. Minimax Function:
   - The minimax function is a recursive algorithm used to determine the optimal move for the AI.
   - Base Cases:
     - If the AI (player 2) wins, it returns positive infinity.
     - If the player (player 1) wins, it returns negative infinity.
     - If the board is full, it returns 0 (draw).
   - Recursive Cases:
     - If it is the maximizing player's turn (AI), it initializes the best score to a very low value and iterates over all possible moves. It updates the best score with the maximum value returned by recursively calling minimax on the resulting board state.
     - If it is the minimizing player's turn (player), it initializes the best score to a very high value and iterates over all possible moves. It updates the best score with the minimum value returned by recursively calling minimax on the resulting board state.
   - Finally, the function returns the best score, representing the optimal move's value.

5. Main Game Loop:
   - The game runs in a loop, handling events like mouse clicks and key presses.
   - On a mouse click, it marks the player's move and checks for a win or draw.
   - If the game is not over, it makes the AI's move using the `best_move` function and checks for a win or draw.
   - If the 'R' key is pressed, the game restarts.
   - The game displays the result when it is over.

6. Game Display Updates:
   - The game updates the display after every event to reflect the current state of the board and game status.
